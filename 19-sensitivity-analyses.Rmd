the following specifications:
* estimated difference in scaled means: 0.1

*  the outcome: 1

# `r fontawesome::fa("laptop")` Application Exercise

1. `devtools::install_github("LucyMcGowan/tipr")`
2. You observed a causal effect of 2 (coefficient from a linear model). You think there could be an unmeasured confounder with a difference in scaled means of 0.5 and a outcome association of 1.2. Use the `adjust_coef()` function to update your observed effect
3. Try to find an unmeasured confounder that would *nullify* your result (make it 0).
4. Knit, commit, push to GitHub

    unexposed population: 0.1

# `r fontawesome::fa("laptop")` Application Exercise

1. You observed a causal effect of 2 (coefficient from a linear model). You think there could be an unmeasured confounder with a difference in scaled means of 0.5. Use the `tip_lb()` function to find an unmeasured confounder-outcome relationship that would be needed to render your causal effect inconclusive
2. Knit, commit, push to GitHub

# Sensitivity analysis


.box-1[Under the assumption that the sensitivity parameters are
fixed, the variance of the observed effect is the same as the variance of the adjusted effect]

.box-1[This allows all adjustments to apply to confidence intervals the same way they would apply to point estimates]
